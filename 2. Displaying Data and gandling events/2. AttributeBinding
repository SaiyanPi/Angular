ATTRIBUTE BINDING

- most of the attributes of HTML element have a one to one mapping(has representation) 
to properties of DOM objects.

- however, there are exceptions.
    -> for example :

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td [colspan] = "colSpan"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        we have a HTML attribute 'colspan' which doesn't have a representation in DOM.

    -> that's why we get an error:
        "Can't bind to 'colspan' since it isn't a known property of 'td'.ngtsc(-998002)"

    -> to bind 'colspan' attribute of <td> elemet we need to use 'attr.' before the attrubute like

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td [attr.colspan] = "colSpan"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

- also we have a properties in DOM that do not have a representation in HTML
    -> for example:
        <h2 [textContent]="title"></h2> 
        here 'textContent is a property of DOM object and in HTML we don't have a such attribute.

- ATTRIBUTE BINDING is binding of HTML attribute
