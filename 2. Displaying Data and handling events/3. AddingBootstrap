ADDING BOOTSTRAP(many ways)

- steps:
    1. install bootstrap: 
        npm install bootstrap --save
        -> this will add the bootstrap entry in package.json dependencies.(see package.json file)
    2. Import its css(bootstrap.css) into our style.css 
        -> @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";



What is the benifit of adding entry in package.json?
-> well, when we check our application code into a source control management tool like git, 
    we're not gonna check in the node_module folder which includes a lot of libraries and takes 
    a fair amount of space on the disc.(repository doesn't include 'node_module' folder)
-> By listing the dependencies inside package.json, anyone who checks out this code from a 
    source control repositiory can simply go to the terminal and type: 'npm install'.
    with this npm looks at the package.json and downloads all the dependencies on the machine.
