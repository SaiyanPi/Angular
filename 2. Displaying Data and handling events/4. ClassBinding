CLASS BINDING

- when we want to add additional classes to the element based on some condition
- for eg, 
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>  
    here we have a bootstrap button class 'btn btn-primary'

- we can add another class 'active' to the above button element based on the state
of underlaying component like

    <button class="btn btn-primary" [class.active]="status">Save</button>

    export class SomeClass{
        //
        status = true;
        //
    }

- if the status is set to true then the 'isActive' is added to the button class and vice versa.
    -> if status = true then class = "btn btn-primary active"
    -> if status = false then class = "btn btn-primary"
