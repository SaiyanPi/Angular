PROPERTY BINDING

- as we already know from the Angular Fundamentals, we can render the property and methods using 
interpolation.
- another way to do so is PROPERTY BINDING.
- inspect ProjectAngular/courses.components.ts file to view implementation.

- WEther we should use STRING INTERPOLATION or PROPERTY BINDING?
    -> INTERPOLATION works well for adding dynamic values between headings.

       eg,  <h2>{{ title }}</h2>

    -> PROPERTY BINDING works only one way from component to DOM

            <h2 [textContent]="title"></h2>

- PROPERTY BINDING is actually binding a property of DOM object and not an attribute of an HTML element.
  in above property binding example 'textContent' is a DOM property.
  (read ATTRIBUTE BINDING and DOM vs HTML for clear understanding)
