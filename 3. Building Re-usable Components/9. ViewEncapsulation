VIEW ENCAPSULATION


-   import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
    //
    encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated
    //
    })
- enum ViewEncapsulation has 3 members
    1) .ShadowDom
    2) .Emulated
    3) .None

1) SHADOW DOM:
    -> allows us to apply scoped styles to elements without bleeding out to the outer world.
    -> not all browser support this.
    -> in favourote.component.ts,

        'encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom' 

        then in favourote.component.html,

         '<button class="btn btn-primary">click</button>'

        will not show a bootstrap primary button because the only styles applied to this element is 
        from the favourite.component.css
    -> if we want to bring bootstrap then we need to import the bootstrap in favourite.component.css(not suggested)

2) EMULATES:
    -> angular tries to emulate the concept of shadowDom.
    -> default value.(99.9% of the time we are not gonna change the value from emulated to other)
    -> angular attaches attribute like '_ngcontent-ng-c40609' to the elements and uses it to apply
        the styles on the element with the same attribute name. This prevents styles bleeding.
        (see ViewEncapsulation.Emulated.PNG in the folder) 
    -> unlike ShadowDom, Bootstrap works!

3) NONE:
    -> doesn't prevent styles bleeding.


THIS IS JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE TERM 'VIEWENCAPSULATION' 99.9% OF THE CASES WE DON'T NEED TO CHANGE THE 
DEFAULT VALUE(.Emulated) SO DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PROPERTY.
