HIDDEN PROPERTY


- instead of using *ngIf directive to show or hide the element, we can use the [hidden] property.
    
                ->  <div hidden>
                        This section is hidden but still visible in inspect element.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        This section will be visible.
                    </div>

                ->  <div [hidden]="courses.length == 0">
                        list of courses
                    </div>
                    <div [hidden]="courses.length > 0">
                        no courses yet
                    </div>

- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN *ngIf and [hidden] PROPERTY?
    -> when we use *ngIf in the element and the condition evaluates to false then that element is
       removed from the DOM.
    -> but when we use the [hidden] property, element is just hidden from the view 
       but still exists in the DOM.

- WHICH IS BETTER?
    -> if we are working on a large element tree with a lot of DOM objects it's better to use ngIf.
        because those elements can take a lot of computing resources and a memory. we don't wanna put
        them in DOM if we are not going to show them to user because angular will continue to check for 
        changes even for a invisible element hence wasting the resources. so, to cut off the unnecessary
        elements and hence saving the resources, we use ngIf.
    -> for small elements tree it's best to use [hidden] property.
