SCAFFOLDING SERVICES

- we can generate a service using angular CLI
- syntax: ng g s service_name
    -> this will generate 2 files service, and the service.spec file
    -> if we inspect the service file then we will see a decorator function 
           
            @Injectable({
                providedIn: 'root'
            })

        just like the component decorator function @Component({......}) in the component.

    -> so the question is WHY DO WE NEED THE SERVICE DECORATOR FUNCTION '@Injectable({..})'?
    -> We need this decorator ONLY IF THE SERVICE HAD DEPENDENCIES IN ITS CONSTRUCTOR.
    -> if we inspect the 'sourses.service.ts' file(created manually), there is no service decorator 
        function there, because sourses service doesn't have any dependencies in its constructor.

        export class CoursesService{
            getCourses(){
            return ['Course I', 'Course II', 'Course III'];
            }
            // no constructor in this service hence no dependencies in the constructor.
        }

    -> but if there were dependencies in the service class constructor like
        export class CoursesService{
            getCourses(){
            return ['Course I', 'Course II', 'Course III'];
            }
            constructor(anyService: anyService){
                //
            }
        }
        then we would have a need of service decorator function.
