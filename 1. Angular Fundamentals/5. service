SERVICES

- we don't write logic for calling an HTTP service directly in the component itself beacuse
    -> it'll tightly couple the component to that HTTP endpoint.
    -> if we need the same logic somewhere else in the application, we have to repeat the same logic code again.
    -> and component should not include any logic other than the presentation logic(logic behind the view). eg, what should happen when selected an item from the dropdown list. 
    but the details of how the content(courses in case of our AngularFundametals) are retrieved should be delegated somewhere else in our application. and we use SERVICES for that.
